# Pet Registration Project

An application which registers a local pet into the pet data system. The application should ask how many pets they would like to register. For each pet they should be asked what type (dog, cat, fish, bird, reptile, or horse). If the type is not a valid registrable pet it should let the user know. If it is, it should echo the price to register the pet for 1 year and confirm price with user. (Use a switch statement). If the user decides to follow through with the registration process, they should than enter the pets Name (String), Address(String), Age(int), Whether they have a Rabies shot (boolean), Yearly Pet Fees (double), and Gender (char). The number of pets that will be entered into the array should be determined at the start of the application. Upon exiting the registered pet details should be echoed to the user.
